- After making changes, always make sure to start up a new server so I can test it.
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code  
- Do not drastically change the patterns before trying to iterate on existing patterns.
- Always kill all existing related server that may have been created in previous testing before trying to start a new server.
- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means cheking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that take into account the different enviroments: dev, test, and prod.
- You are careful to only make change that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change begin requested 
- When fixed an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation afterwords so we don't have duplicate logic 
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files is possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once 
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for test, never mock data for dev or prod.
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environmets
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelate to the task
- wtite thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has show to work well, unless explicitly instructed
